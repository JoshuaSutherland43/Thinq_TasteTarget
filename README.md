## 📈 Behind the Scenes

### A. Inspiration
Modern marketing still relies on blunt tools like “25–34-year-old urban women.” We flipped that script. Instead of asking *who* your audience is, we ask *what they feel, love, and value*.

TasteTarget is built to shift strategy from demographics to *emotions and culture* — with no compromise on privacy.

### B. What We Learned

- Simulated Qloo’s clustering using structured GPT-4 prompts  
- Developed tone-adaptive copy generation (e.g. bold, poetic, witty)  
- Proved AI can build rich customer personas faster and with more nuance than traditional methods

---

### C. How We Built It

1. **Frontend**: Streamlit dashboard with real-time inputs and previews  
2. **Backend**: FastAPI server to manage prompt logic and API interactions  
3. **LLM Integration**: GPT-4 for persona generation + copywriting  
4. **Visuals**: Hugging Face models fine-tuned for cultural prompts

---

  - 2–3 culturally-aligned personas
